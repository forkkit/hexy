                                great way to find colors on Hexy is to search.
                                If you're looking for a nice shade of green, by
                                all means type in "green" â€” you will get a lot
                                of greens to choose from.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Yet, not all greens will have "green" in the
                                name so you can also get creative and search for
                                things like "willow" or "tree" or "forest" or
                                "wasabi".
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                You can also try descriptors like "vivid" or
                                "muted" and adjectives like "vintage" or
                                "tropical".

                                You can also search for specific hex values and
                                if there is no named color, Hexy will return the
                                closest named color.
